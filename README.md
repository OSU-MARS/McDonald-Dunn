### Overview
This repo contains research code pertaining to the McDonald-Dunn Research Forest. Since it doesn't contain the data (it's not something this research group has permission to release) it's unlikely to be of interest unless you're working on the forest, peer reviewing the code, or are interested in replicating similar work elsewhere.

### Dependencies
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is the primary tool used here, mainly via [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) Desktop, and thus most code is in .R files.
